Created an application that allows user(s) to select the following:

number of characters wanted in a generated password from 8 to 128
uppercase letters
lowercase letters
special characters (!@#$%^&*)
numbers

Users are allowed to omit if they don't want uppercase, lowercase, special characters, or numbers. Only aspect needed is the # of letters in the password as if there are no letters in a password it's not exactly a password now is it?
